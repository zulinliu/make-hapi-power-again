 * Returns true when the tool name identifies a subagent invocation.
 *
 * The Claude Code SDK has used two names for the same concept:
 *   - 'Task'  — earlier SDK releases
 *   - 'Agent' — later SDK releases (OPUS 4.7+ environment)
 *
 * Both share the same input shape: { prompt: string, subagent_type: string }.
 * The tracer, reducer, and UI surfaces must treat them identically.
 * Keeping both ensures sessions recorded under either name continue to work.
